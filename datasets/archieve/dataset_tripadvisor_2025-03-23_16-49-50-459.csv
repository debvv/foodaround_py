The hotel is located in a building that dates back to 1875, built with the participation of the renowned architect Alexander Bernardazzi. The first owner of the building where ""Zentrum Apartments"" is located was Sevastia Balabanova — a great connoisseur and patron of fine arts. She opened an art gallery on the ground floor of the new house. Young painters from Chisinau as well as from many other cities and foreigners had their works exhibited in that gallery.

Thanks to a man who opened in the long-gone nineties an inconspicuous shashlik (shish kebab) house in the capital. For many years they cooked the best meat in the city there, and after a while the chargrill moved to historical center, having turned into one of the most prestigious restaurants. The man’s name was Sarkis, and this name has been proudly adorned on the signboard for twelve years, becoming not only a synonym for impeccable quality, but also setting a quite high standard the entire restaurant business. Today, “La Sarkis” is a large two-stored restaurant with a winter terrace which may be turned into a summer terrace during the warm season. Few food outlets can boast of such a shelter: a closed terrace is decorated with a custom-made glass fireplace and a winter garden that only enhances the fabulousness of what is happening.","Vegetarian friendly",,,"Salad","Soup","Ribeye Steak",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Restaurants",,"Delivery","Takeout","Reservations","Outdoor Seating","Private Dining","Seating","Parking Available","Street Parking","Highchairs Available","Serves Alcohol","Full Bar","Wine and Beer","Free Wifi","Accepts Credit Cards","Table Service",,,,,,,,,"Europe/Chisinau","1439","23:59","0","00:00","1439","23:59","0","00:00","1439","23:59","0","00:00","1439","23:59","0","00:00","1439","23:59","0","00:00","1439","23:59","0","00:00",,,,,"1439","23:59","0","00:00",,,,,,,,,,,,,"3643106","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/01/90/9c/la-sarkis.jpg","Chisinau Moldova","true","Claimed","false","false","false","47.023235",,"","Chisinau, Chisinau District","28.817225","Breakfast","Lunch","Dinner","Brunch","Late Night","Drinks",,"La Sarkis","148",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Open Now",,"+373 608 00 400","112","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/01/90/9c/la-sarkis.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/d0/44/95/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/d0/44/94/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/d0/44/93/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/d0/44/92/caption.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/4e/9c/33/20210710-120958-largejpg.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/4e/9c/34/20210710-110804-largejpg.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/4e/9c/35/20210710-103009-largejpg.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/4e/9c/36/20210710-103004-largejpg.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/4e/9c/37/20210710-112755-largejpg.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/4e/9c/38/20210710-112758-largejpg.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/ad/77/cd/caption.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/ad/77/ce/caption.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/ad/77/cf/caption.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/ad/77/d0/caption.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/ad/77/d1/caption.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/fd/a0/ee/caption.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/f9/82/5a/caption.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/f9/82/5b/caption.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/22/98/7b/5d/caption.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1e/02/11/9c/caption.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1e/01/ff/44/perfect-treat-location.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/6b/9e/69/la-sarkis.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"$$$$",,"319","32","#32 of 417 places to eat in Chisinau","4.1","9","7","21","41","70","3.4033706188201904","5","khachapuri","3","nice restaurant","2","wine list","2","moldovan wines","5","armenia","6","dishes","6","music",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sit down",,,,,,,,,,,"RESTAURANT","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294456-d3643106-Reviews-La_Sarkis-Chisinau_Chisinau_District.html","http://lasarkis.com/caucasus/",

Very quickly that grill-bar grew to a beautiful, two-storey restaurant where now you can enjoy both the tastes of excellent meat and any other dish of the European fusion cuisine. Pegas restaurant is very conveniently located and is easy to find. Here you will always find a pleasant and friendly atmosphere, both for a family meal or a fun gathering of friends or colleagues. A special attention is paid to the comfort of children: the green lawn of the restaurant's summer terrace hosts a spacious playground for children. No doubt, everything in the restaurant is open and available for its guests. When the large meal is brought, you shouldn't be surprised: once you entered the doors of Pegas restaurant it is clear that you can get here all you want - attention, comfort and delicious food. At your request, each dish can be cooked as you prefer. Also, a pleasant fact is that Pegas works 24 hours a day seven days a week. The restaurant can host different events: whether it's a dinner for a small company or a large event. Here you will find absolutely all the ingredients for a successful party. You will be pleasantly surprised when you will get the bill. According to the manager of the restaurant, Irina Bespaliuc, the pleasure of spending time at Pegas restaurant isn't expensive, but it's worth it. The values of Pegas restaurant are: honesty, responsibility, openness, good organisation and positive spirit.","Vegetarian friendly","Vegan options","Gluten free options","Pasta","Filet

It was greatly decorated with NY visuals, had friendly service and management, with a mix of original American & international classic food & beverage recipes. New York proved that a really friendly and fun place with an American character can be created in a city where the lifestyle is heavily influenced by old soviet habits. The service and quality levels of New York were described as good or even better than the best examples of world renowned restaurants with similar concepts. New York was offering happy hours, various concept parties on weekends, and days with a special thematic. All these were able to blend foreigners of different cultures with the locals enjoying the same atmosphere almost every day. Unfortunately, New York had to shut down in 2006, due to another successful commercial decision taken by the owners for its location. Fortunately we are back. To this day, the closing of this highly popular place was considered a big loss for the Chisinau social life. Recently, New York has reopened its doors with more tempting offers, delightful and exclusive dishes and the perfect atmosphere for its beloved guests.","Vegetarian friendly",,,"Pasta","Burger","Pesto","Burger and Fries","Fresh Pasta","Ribeye Steak",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"info.chisinau@radissonblu.com","Restaurants",,"Delivery","Takeout","Reservations","Outdoor Seating","Seating","Street Parking","Television","Highchairs Available","Wheelchair Accessible","Serves Alcohol","Full Bar","American Express","Mastercard","Visa","Free Wifi","Discover","Accepts Credit Cards","Table Service",,,,,,"Europe/Chisinau","1620","03:00","480","08:00","1620","03:00","480","08:00","1620","03:00","480","08:00","1620","03:00","480","08:00","1620","03:00","480","08:00","1620","03:00","480","08:00",,,,,"1620","03:00","480","08:00",,,,,,,,,,,,,"8792311","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/97/e3/cf/new-york-restaurant-bar.jpg","Chisinau Moldova","true","Claimed","false","false","false","47.024303",,"","Chisinau, Chisinau District","28.836582","Breakfast","Lunch","Dinner","Brunch","Late Night","Drinks","https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d66c36919efcd000172977e/t/658e8456a156b677382c31a0/1703838814365/NYR_Menu_FOOD_DEC2023_ENG_FINAL_WEB.pdf","New York Restaurant & Bar","201",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Open Now",,"+373 22 201 202","96","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/74/74/27/new-york-restaurant-bar.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/97/e3/cf/new-york-restaurant-bar.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/74/74/25/entrance.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/57/9b/8f/getlstd-property-photo.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/74/74/2a/new-york-restaurant-bar.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/74/74/29/new-york-restaurant-bar.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/c2/09/5f/caption.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/fd/9b/e6/caption.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/46/48/24/caption.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/46/48/26/caption.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/46/48/27/caption.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/46/48/28/caption.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"$$ - $$$",,"333","1","#1 of 333 Restaurants in Chisinau","4.7","5","4","9","19","164","4.836816787719727","2","the radisson blu","3","moldova",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sit down",,,,,,,,,,,"RESTAURANT","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294456-d8792311-Reviews-New_York_Restaurant_Bar-Chisinau_Chisinau_District.html","https://www.newyorkrestaurant.md/",

And one more thing should be mentioned: you will not find any other interior similar to the one in ""El Paso"" in the other restaurants of the city. It has been designed after a Mexican log hut and a patio with an idea to bring you even closer to the faraway and mysterious Mexico. ""El Paso"" has the air-conditioned larger banquet room and the smaller one, both waiting for you. Furthermore, the open-air terrace tables are available to the customers when it is warm outside, and you can enjoy your Mexican dish there, accompanied with the excellent ""Corona"" beer.","Vegetarian friendly","Vegan options",,"Fajitas","Chicken dishes","Guacamole",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Restaurants",,"Takeout","Reservations","Outdoor Seating","Seating","Serves Alcohol","Table Service",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Europe/Chisinau","1380","23:00","720","12:00","1380","23:00","720","12:00","1380","23:00","720","12:00","1380","23:00","720","12:00","1380","23:00","720","12:00","1380","23:00","720","12:00",,,,,"1380","23:00","720","12:00",,,,,,,,,,,,,"1105075","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/04/54/ed/f8/el-paso.jpg","Chisinau Moldova","true","Claimed","false","false","false","47.01428",,"","Chisinau, Chisinau District","28.831642","Lunch","Dinner",,,,,,"El Paso","89",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Open Now",,"+373 22 921 166","49","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/54/ed/f8/el-paso.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/bd/82/a5/el-paso.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/bd/82/a1/el-paso.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/bd/81/90/el-paso.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/02/94/08/f3/filename-img-20120701.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/10/3f/6c/ff/paella-a-la-el-paso-chisinau.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/5e/b1/9e/img-20160523-171049-largejpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/2d/a9/a9/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/2d/a9/a8/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/58/55/38/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/a6/c9/49/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/47/54/0b/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/47/54/0a/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/47/54/09/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/47/54/08/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/47/54/07/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/47/54/06/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/26/bb/57/08/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/21/da/1b/8e/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/21/da/1b/8d/caption.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/47/54/0b/caption.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/47/54/0a/caption.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/47/54/09/caption.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/47/54/08/caption.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/47/54/07/caption.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/47/54/06/caption.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/2d/a9/a8/caption.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/2d/a9/a9/caption.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/21/da/1b/8c/caption.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/21/da/1b/8d/caption.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/21/da/1b/8e/caption.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/58/55/38/caption.jpg","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/26/bb/57/08/caption.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"$$ - $$$",,"333","32","#32 of 333 Restaurants in Chisinau","4.2","2","3","13","31","40","3.3905558586120605","11","fajitas","2","lamb","9","mexican food","4","sizzling","17","moldova",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sit down",,,,,,,,,,,"RESTAURANT","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294456-d1105075-Reviews-El_Paso-Chisinau_Chisinau_District.html","http://www.el-paso.md/",
